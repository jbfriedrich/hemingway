# Hemingway

Simple blogging theme for [Ghost >= 2.x](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost). Borrowing ideas from [Medium](https://medium.com/) and the [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) default theme. The theme uses internal tags to distinguish different post types. For now, it distinguishes between "posts", "micro posts" and "links".
